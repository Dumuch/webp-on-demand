# location of converted files: seperate folder
#     Generated files to be placed in a separate folder, "/webp-cache/". Ie the
#     webp image corresponding to "/images/logo.jpg" will become "/webp-cache/images/logo.jpg.webp"
#     You can change the name of the folder, but make sure to change it in all places.
#     If you would the converted images to be placed in the same folder as the source, go for "webp-on-demand 1a" instead

# location of webp-on-demand.php and .htaccess:  webroot
#     These rules needs to be in a .htaccess in the webroot.
#     Also, webp-on-demand.php needs to be in the webroot.
#     If you would have webp-on-demand.php in a subfolder, go for "webp-on-demand 2b" instead
