# webp-on-demand (destination-root, .htaccess not in webroot)
# --------------------------------------------
# Use the following rules, if you want the generated files to be placed in a separate folder, "/webp-cache/". Ie the
# webp image corresponding to "/images/logo.jpg" will become "/webp-cache/images/logo.jpg.webp"
# You can change the name of the folder, but make sure to change it in all places.
# Do not add full url with http in the rewrite rules, it will cause an extra request

# In this example, the .htaccess isn't in webroot, but in a folder named 'your-folder'
# (replace accordingly)
